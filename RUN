To calculate the radiative and non-radiative rates of transitions we can use MOMAP (Molecular Materials Property Prediction Package) code available here: http://www.momap.net.cn/.
In th manual, the authors suggest performing the required calculations in the Gaussian package. However, sometimes, problematic system requires spin-flip procdure, which is not available in the Gaussian package.
Here is how to do it in the QChem program, along with the Python scripts to visualize and convert data properly.

1. Produce the outputs for:  optimization of the ground state (azulene-s0.in), first excited state of singlet manifold (azulene-s1.in) and triplet state (azulene-t1.in). The queuing script named qchem.sub can be invoked with:
qchem.sub *.in
